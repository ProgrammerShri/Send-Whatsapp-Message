In this app we can directly send the whatsaap message without saving any mobile number using your desktop or mobile device.

### Problem Statement (User Prespective) :

We interact with many other people in our daily lives for a variety of reasons. But sometimes we don't want to connect with people for a long time or only for a short time. (For example, Messages or Media Forwarding, Document Sharing, etc...) and then we don't want to stay connected.

In our daily life we use whatsapp as a primary messenger for communication. we don't want to save someone number for temporary reasons.

- When you're saving someone number in your device than the people will get more details about you
  Like

  - Profile Picture
  - Status
  - Story
  - Your last seen activity

  This is a major privacy concern.
